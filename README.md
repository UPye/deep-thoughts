# Description
 
    This is a REACT single page application, and uses a custom built API with server. Server uses jwt-decode to store JSON Web Token to the localStorage drive, checks to ensure it isn't expired, and deletes it when logging out without making another server request. User is able to login or sign up to add a thought, add a reaction to a thought, or reply to their own thought. User may view profile to render friends and thoughts in one place. Used React Router to give multi-page feel.
